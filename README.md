mf-alarm
========

Multifunctional Arduino based alarm system

System will be able to monitor defined array of sensors and operate various alarm devices when neccessary.

Currently in a very alpha stage - some scaffolding code that is untested on a real device.

TODO:

-Test current basic implementation on a real device
-Fix errors and refactor the library
-Add confugurable settings file for general adjustments

For future releases:
-Implement RFID operated lock
-Implement GSM operated lock
-Web status monitoring / REST service

When I have the neccessary parts, I will include the schematics for the alarm.
