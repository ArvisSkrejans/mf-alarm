mf-alarm
========

Multifunctional Arduino based alarm system

System will be able to monitor defined array of sensors and operate various alarm devices when neccessary.

Currently in a very alpha stage - some scaffolding code that has only the basic logic parts covered.

TODO:

-Add functional code with real sensors
-Fix errors and refactor the library
-Add confugurable settings file for general adjustments
-Add wiring diagrams and general alarm setup information

For future releases:
-Implement RFID operated lock
-Implement GSM operated lock
-Create ability to easily extend the lib for various sensors and output types
-Web status monitoring / REST service
